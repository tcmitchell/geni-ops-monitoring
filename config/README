This README describes some of the configuration files in this
directory.

collector_operator.conf: configuration settings for the database that
runs on the collector host.

config_datastore_operator.conf: appears to be unused.

database_conf_loader.py: python module to parse the database
configuration files in this directory.

local_datastore_operator.conf: configuration settings for the database
that runs on the local datastore host.

logging.conf: configuration settings for the logging system.

opsconfig.json.jwc: a multipurpose file that contains the list of
aggregate stores, the database table schemas, and the event
definitions for time-series data for aggregates, nodes, interfaces,
interfacevlans, and experiments.

whitelist.conf:

This file contains a list of URNs identifying collectors that should
be allowed to get data from local datastores.  These URNs originate
from the collector tool certificate's Subject Alternative Name.  If a
collector attempts to access data using a certificate whose URN is not
on this list, the web server will refuse access.  See
http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/OperationalMonitoring/DatastorePolling#Security
for more information.

Initially, GPO will maintain this list in our git repository, with a
link to it at the above URL.  This list will contain all of the
collectors to whom tool certificates have been issued.  Local
datastore operators can update their local copies of the whitelist
from this source at their discretion, e.g., a nightly cron job.  They
can also have a completely independent whitelist to enable different
local access policies.

We will investigate maintenance and distribution of the whitelist via
other channels, e.g., the config store database, in future releases.
