Changes for Release 2.0
August 28, 2014
------------------------------

* A new program, collector/rest_call.py, replaces several others
  for exercisng the REST API and validating JSON responses.

* If your local datastore is listening on port 5001, we recommend
  switching to port 4334 to avoid conflicting with iperf.

* The REST calls changed as follows:

  * In the bulk data request (/data/?q={"filters"...), if the list
    of object ids contains a "*", then data is returned for all
    possible objects.

* The JSON schemas for the responses to REST calls changed as follows:

  * In sliver.schema:
    * The field creator_urn is renamed to creator because it might not
      be a URN.
    * The field resources is renamed to resource, which is now
      required and can only contain one resource instead of a list.
      resource has subfields resoure_type, urn, and href.
  * In aggregate.schema:
    * New required fields: monitoring_version and
      operational_status.
    * New optional fields: populator_version, routable_ip_poolsize.
  * In node.schema:
    * New required field node_type.
    * ops_monitoring:vm_server_type is renamed to virtualization_type.
  * In interface.schema:
    * New field addresses to hold the list of addresses for an
      interface.  This replaces the address (singular) field.

* The local datastore's database schema changed as follows:
 1. ops_link table now has a layer column
 2. There is a new ops_link_relations to express parent/child relation between links.
 3. The ops_link_interfacevlan no longer has the urn and selfRef columns.

  * The ops_sliver table has new fields node_id and link_id
    that need to be populated.
  * The ops_sliver_resource table is gone.  Use the ops_sliver
    table instead.
  * The ops_aggregate table has new fields populator_version,
    operational_status, and routable_ip_poolsize that need to
    be populated.
  * In the ops_node table:
    * properties$vm_server_type is renamed to virtualization_type.
    * New required field node_type.
  * In the ops_interface table:
    * Removed fields address_type and address_address.
  * There is a new table ops_interface_addresses to hold the
    addresses for an interface.

Changes for Release 1.1_patch1
June 4, 2014
------------------------------

* The main purpose of this patch is to fix ops-monitoring ticket 56.
  This defect caused local datastores to return invalid JSON
  responses.  In cases where an optional field did not have a value,
  the defect caused a value of None to be returned, which fails JSON
  validation. The fix is to omit the field entirely from the response
  in this case.  The main files affected are config/opsconfig.json
  and local/rest_call_handler.py, with related fixes to the collector
  in collector/single_local_datastore_info_crawler.py .

Other notable changes that are in this patch:

* opsconfig.json has been updated in these ways:
  1. contains a far more complete list of aggregates.
  2. num_vms_allocated moved from the aggregate to the node.
  3. vm_server_type was added to the node.

  #2 and #3 change the database tables, so you'll need to
  regenerate them.

* Some locking was removed from local/rest_call_handler.py to
  attempt to address problems with hanging queries.

* The endpoints of a link were made optional in schema/link.schema.

* The authority part of schema/user.schema was fixed to be like
  that of slices.

* Some work in progress on the external check datastore is included.


Changes for Release 1.0  
May 1, 2014
-----------------------

* SSL is used to enable local datastores to verify the identity of
  collectors.  Collectors must present a valid tool certificate to
  be allowed access.  See local/README for the required Apache2
  configuration, collector/README for using tool certificates,
  and config/README for configuring the whitelist of allowed
  collectors.
  
* The database schemas are all read from config/opsconfig.json,
  which is a dictionary containing this configuration.  See the
  README at local/README point 6 for details of the schema.  The
  only change to tables that existed prior to this release are the
  measurement event tables.  The table names now are named 
  "ops_<object_type>_<event_type>".  Before <object_type> did not
  exist.

* All selfRef and href entries into the database tables should be 
  changed from http to https.

* All $schema entries in the database for which json-schema to use
  should point to:
  http://www.gpolab.bbn.com/monitoring/schema/20140501/<obj_type>#
  Notice the data change to 20140501 and that the base url starts
  with gpolab instead of unis for all schemas.
