Changes for Release 1.0  
May 1, 2014
-----------------------

* SSL is used to enable local datastores to verify the identity of
  collectors.  Collectors must present a valid tool certificate to
  be allowed access.  See local/README for the required Apache2
  configuration and collector/README for using tool certificates.

* The database schemas are all read from config/opsconfig.json,
  which is a dictionary containing this configuration.  See the
  README at local/README point 6 for details of the schema.  The
  only change to tables that existed prior to this release are the
  measurement event tables.  The table names now are named 
  "ops_<object_type>_<event_type>".  Before <object_type did not
  exists.
