Changes for Release 1.0  
May 1, 2014
-----------------------

* SSL is used to enable local datastores to verify the identity of
  collectors.  Collectors must present a valid tool certificate to
  be allowed access.  See local/README for the required Apache2
  configuration, collector/README for using tool certificates,
  and config/README for configuring the whitelist of allowed
  collectors.
  
* The database schemas are all read from config/opsconfig.json,
  which is a dictionary containing this configuration.  See the
  README at local/README point 6 for details of the schema.  The
  only change to tables that existed prior to this release are the
  measurement event tables.  The table names now are named 
  "ops_<object_type>_<event_type>".  Before <object_type> did not
  exist.

* All selfRef and href entries into the database tables should be 
  changed from http to https.

* All $schema entries in the database for which json-schema to use
  should point to:
  http://www.gpolab.bbn.com/monitoring/schema/20140501/<obj_type>#
  Notice the data change to 20140501 and that the base url starts
  with gpolab instead of unis for all schemas.
