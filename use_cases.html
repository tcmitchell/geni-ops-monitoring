<body><h1>Categorization of suggested monitoring use cases</h1>
<p><i>This page is a rough draft summarizing monitoring use cases
collected from GENI participants during November 2013, and attempts to
provide high-level guesses about the tools needed to implement each.
The page contains 45 distinct use cases summarized from inputs from
18 people.  This page was last updated on 2013-12-12.
