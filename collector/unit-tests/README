Follow the ops-monitoring/collector/README to install and configure
packages to run these programs.

1. collector_table_reset.py

  This resets/initializes the table structure at the collector's
  database.  The program reads in opsconfig.json and creates tables in
  the "info" key with the db_schema present there in a straightforward
  manner.  

  The "events" key creates a tables named after the event
  type: ops_<object-type>_<event-name> where object-type is a "node"
  or "interface" and event-name is "mem_used_kb".  The columns of the
  event tables are all aggregate_id (really this is datastore_id), id
  for object id, ts for timestamp, and v which is of whatever type
  specified in the subdictionary of that event (as shown in the
  particular event sub-dictionary).
