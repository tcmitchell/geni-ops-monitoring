These are examples of the data schema.  These should be generalized to
form the schema requirements for monitoring project participants.

Assumptions and notes regarding examples:

* https://datastore.instageni.gpolab.bbn.com/ is the URL of the local
  datastore which serves both metadata and measurement data about
  gpo-ig - this could be any URL, the choice of a concrete location
  is just for illustration purposes

* I decided to call our project 'ops_monitoring' in the context of
  this schema, and therefore where defining novel properties,
  eventTypes, etc, i used that namespace

* The $schema parameter does *not* need to be transmitted with the
  data; it's just included in each file for clarity.

* Individual files shouldn't contain comments, because json.load()
  doesn't like that either.  Put any commentary needed in the README.

In general, to test a file using validictory:

  import validictory
  import json
  import urllib2
  
  datafile = <path to example file you want to test>
  
  data = json.load(open(datafile))
  schema = json.load(urllib2.urlopen(data['$schema']))
  validictory.validate(data, schema)

No output means validictory considers the file to be valid.
