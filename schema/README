Current thinking is to adapt the UNIS data schemas for GENI operational
monitoring use.  In particular:

* http://unis.incntre.iu.edu/schema/20120709/networkresource:
  Metadata about a resource in GENI, what we've historically called
  "relational data" and/or what has been implicitly specified as
  configuration data.  In UNIS parlance:
  * an aggregate or authority is a networkresource subtype (domain)
  * a compute node or network device is a networkresource subtype (node)
  * an interface is a networkresource subtype (port)
  * a link is a networkresource subtype (link) that connects two ports
  * a local datastore would be a networkresource subtype (service),
    or we might extend that further

* http://unis.incntre.iu.edu/schema/20120709/metadata:
  Metadata about a metric.  This defines a unique (per-domain) ID,
  a "subject", the networkresource to which the metric pertains, an
  "eventType" which is the type of metric, and parameters indicating
  what kind of data goes into the metric

* http://unis.incntre.iu.edu/schema/20120709/tsdatum
  Time-series metric values.  This defines a timestamp,value tuple.
  An array of these would be (all or part of) the response to an API
  request for measurement data.
