Current thinking is to adapt the UNIS data schemas for GENI operational
monitoring use.  In particular:

* http://unis.incntre.iu.edu/schema/20120709/networkresource:
  Metadata about a resource in GENI, what we've historically called
  "relational data" and/or what has been implicitly specified as
  configuration data.  In UNIS parlance:
  * an aggregate or authority is a networkresource subtype (domain)
  * a compute node or network device is a networkresource subtype (node)
  * an interface is a networkresource subtype (port)
  * a link is a networkresource subtype (link) that connects two ports
  * a local datastore would be a networkresource subtype (service),
    or we might extend that further

* schema/data.schema:
  * To be posted as: http://www.gpolab.bbn.com/monitoring/schema/20140131/data
  * Combined data and metadata about a metric --- contains all features
    of the following two UNIS types, but combines them into one type
    for our current convenience:
    * http://unis.incntre.iu.edu/schema/20120709/metadata:
      Metadata about a metric.  This defines a unique (per-domain) ID,
      a "subject", the networkresource to which the metric pertains, an
      "eventType" which is the type of metric, and parameters indicating
      what kind of data goes into the metric
    * http://unis.incntre.iu.edu/schema/20120709/tsdatum
      Time-series metric values.  This defines a timestamp,value tuple.
      An array of these form the tsdata array of the response to an API
      request for measurement data.
