This is GPO code for the GENI operational monitoring project.
There should be one subdirectory for each component.  For links to all
documentation of the operational monitoring project, see:

  http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/OperationalMonitoring

This codebase is a set of reference components which fully or partially
implement parts of the monitoring component model listed at:

  http://www.gpolab.bbn.com/monitoring/components/

Contents of this directory:
 * Directories which implement components of the ops monitoring model:
   * alerting/: reference alerting utilities (component (a)) - working 
                prototype
   * collector/: reference aggregator (component (b)) - working prototype
   * schema/: schema/examples for datastore polling API (component (c))
              - working prototype
   * local/: reference local datastore (component (d)) - working prototype
 * Directories containing helper code:
