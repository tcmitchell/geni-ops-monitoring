Some plugins in this directory will use the nagiosplugin python
library (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nagiosplugin/)

The library uses the following design to construct nagios checks:
             +----------+                \
             | Resource |                 |
             +----------+                 |
       _____/      |     \_____           | Acquisition
      v            v           v          |
+---------+   +---------+   +---------+   |
| Metric  |...| Metric  |...| Metric  |  <
+---------+   +---------+   +---------+   |
     |             |             |        |
     v             v             v        |
+---------+   +---------+   +---------+   |
| Context |...| Context |...| Context |   | Evaluation
+---------+   +---------+   +---------+   |
     |             |             |        |
     v             v             v        |
+---------+   +---------+   +---------+   |
| Result  |...| Result  |...| Result  |  <
+---------+   +---------+   +---------+   |
           \___    |    ___/              |
               v   v   v                  | Presentation
              +---------+                 |
              | Summary |                 |
              +---------+                /

The resource class has a "probe" command that is responsible for obtaining the
data to polulate the Metric object.  We can create commands for constructing
values that we care about in the geniprobes.py library, and reuse those 
commands in probe methods for multiple Resource objects to create more complex
(but contextualized) checks, thus reducing the number of checks that need to 
run total.
