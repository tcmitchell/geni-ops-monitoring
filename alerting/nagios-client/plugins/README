Some plugins in this directory will use the nagiosplugin python
library (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nagiosplugin/)

The library uses the following design to construct nagios checks:
             +----------+                \
             | Resource |                 |
             +----------+                 |
       _____/      |     \_____           | Acquisition
      v            v           v          |
+---------+   +---------+   +---------+   |
| Metric  |...| Metric  |...| Metric  |  <
+---------+   +---------+   +---------+   |
     |             |             |        |
     v             v             v        |
+---------+   +---------+   +---------+   |
| Context |...| Context |...| Context |   | Evaluation
+---------+   +---------+   +---------+   |
     |             |             |        |
     v             v             v        |
+---------+   +---------+   +---------+   |
| Result  |...| Result  |...| Result  |  <
+---------+   +---------+   +---------+   |
           \___    |    ___/              |
               v   v   v                  | Presentation
              +---------+                 |
              | Summary |                 |
              +---------+                /

The resource class has a "probe" command that is responsible for obtaining 
the data to polulate the Metric object.
