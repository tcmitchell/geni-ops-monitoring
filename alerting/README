1. Architecture
---------------
Section 1 introduces the basic architecture of the alerting system in the
reference implementation.

For the reference implementation, we are using nagios and nrpe.

   |________________________________|


The architecture for alerting is broken up into two major components:
 * Nagios Server
 * Nagios Client (must run on aggregator server)

This split is done in order to allow for an aggregator to be integrated 
with an existing nagios server.  It is also possible to deploy both the 
nagios server and the aggregator server on the same host, for those who
need to stand up a new nagios server.

1.2. Nagios Server
------------------
The nagios server can be a standard nagios server with the nrpe plugin
installed.

1.3. Nagios Client
------------------
The nagios client must be running on the aggregator server.  The nagios 
client may run on the same host as the nagios server, or it can be split
off and run on a separate server, allowing for easier integration with 
existing nagios server deployments.

Most of the development work for alerting happens on the nagios client, 
specifically in the nagios plugins and the query library.


2. Environment Setup
--------------------

2.1. Nagios Server
------------------

2.1.1. Nagios Server Config
---------------------------
Customized configuration files for the nagios server can be found in the 
following directory:

    alerting/nagios-server/config

The following are descriptions of the config files:

 * aggregates.cfg: All host and service checks should be defined here.
                   Currently, we define a template for a service check, and
                   then use that template for individual hosts.  In the
                   reference config, a host corresponds to an aggregate.

 * cgi.cfg:        This is the standard cgi.cfg file.  Some authentication
                   config changes have been made for the reference
                   implementation.

 * commands.cfg:   This is the standard commands.cfg file.  In here, the 
                   nrpe commands for the aggregator must be defined, and 
                   they must point at the aggregator host

 * nagios.cfg:     This is a standard nagios.cfg file.  In the reference
                   implementation, localhost checks are disabled, and there
                   is a cfg_file defined for the path to aggregates.cfg

2.1.2 Adding a New Service Check
--------------------------------
To add a check for a new metric, you will modify aggregates.cfg.  Add a 
template for a specific type of service check near the top of the file.

After doing this, add a new service check in the host sections for each
aggregate you want to run the check against, and use the service check
template by leveraging the "use" declaration.

2.2. Nagios Client
------------------

2.2.1. Nagios Plugins Environment Setup
---------------------------------------
Currently, nagios plugins are developed using the nagiosplugin python
package.  We are using version 1.2.  To install this package on the nagios
client host, log into the host and run the following commands:


cd ~
wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/n/nagiosplugin/nagiosplugin-1.2.tar.gz#md5=2f2d26e8a1b846fd4db936ef00a1a4e3
tar xvzf ~/nagiosplugin-1.2.tar.gz
cd ~/nagiosplugin-1.2
sudo python setup.py install


Nagios plugins are run run using the NRPE server package.  Please install 
the package using your host's package manager.  Known package names:
 * Ubuntu: nagios-nrpe-server
 * CentOS: nagios-nrpe


2.2.2. Nagios Client Config
---------------------------
Customized configuration files for the nagios client can be found in the 
following directory:

    alerting/nagios-client/config

The following are descriptions of the config files:

 * geni_plugins.cfg: This is where all commands are defined for plugins
                     that run on the nagios client host.  This shouldn't
                     need to be modified from the reference implementation
                     unless you want to add more plugins or modify the
                     WARNING and CRITICAL levels of a given plugin.

 * nrpe.cfg:         This is the standard nrpe.cfg file.  Make sure that
                     allowed_hosts includes the nagios server, and ensure
                     that dont_blame_nrpe is set to 1, because plugins 
                     defined in the reference implementation require 
                     arguments to be passed to the plugins.

2.2.3. Plugin Development
-------------------------
Documentation on using the library can be found at:

    http://pythonhosted.org/nagiosplugin/

Example plugins can be found under:

    alerting/nagios-client/plugins

Plugins should make calls to the query library for the aggregator, and
based on that information, it should be able to form metrics that are
returned back to nagios.  Plugins should *never* make calls directly to the
aggregator database.  If there is a query that needs to be added, please
provide a new method in the query library under the aggregator module.

2.2.4. Deploying a Plugin
-------------------------
Once your plugin is ready, copy it over into the following directory:

    /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/

Ensure that the permissions match those of other plugins.  Once that is
done, add a command definition for the new plugin in the following file:

    geni_plugins.cfg

After that is complete, restart the nrpe service, and the plugin should
be ready to go.

2.3. Query Library
--------------------
The query library is part of the aggregator module.  Please see the
aggregator module for more information.

3. Database Access
------------------
TBD

The plugins need to access the aggregator database, but the model for how
to set this up properly is still under discussion.
