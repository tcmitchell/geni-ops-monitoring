Some plugins in this directory will use the nagiosplugin python
library (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nagiosplugin/)

The library uses the following design to construct nagios checks:
             +----------+                \
             | Resource |                 |
             +----------+                 |
       _____/      |     \_____           | Acquisition
      v            v           v          |
+---------+   +---------+   +---------+   |
| Metric  |...| Metric  |...| Metric  |  <
+---------+   +---------+   +---------+   |
     |             |             |        |
     v             v             v        |
+---------+   +---------+   +---------+   |
| Context |...| Context |...| Context |   | Evaluation
+---------+   +---------+   +---------+   |
     |             |             |        |
     v             v             v        |
+---------+   +---------+   +---------+   |
| Result  |...| Result  |...| Result  |  <
+---------+   +---------+   +---------+   |
           \___    |    ___/              |
               v   v   v                  | Presentation
              +---------+                 |
              | Summary |                 |
              +---------+                /

A single Resource and Summary map to a single nagios check, but each
check can have multiple Metric/Context/Result paths.  With this design,
we can build a library of Metrics based on the primitives defined in
the data schema, and then we can use those Metric classes to construct
more complex checks which are more useful to operators.
