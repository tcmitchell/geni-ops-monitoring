# This file provides a set of make variables that define the locations
# of various things, mostly libraries (a.k.a. modules), that may
# need to be referenced from other parts of the tree.  By using the
# symbolic names here, we avoid hardcoding paths into the makefiles,
# making tree reorganization less painful.


# $(call declare-module,name,dir)
# Generate make variable declarations for a module.
#
# Arguments:
# $1 : name of the module as it will appear in other makefiles
# $2 : directory containing the module's sources
#
# For example, if name ($1) is FOO, this function will provide
# the following make variables that can be used in other
# makefiles to refer to this module:
#
# FOO_DIR, directory containing the module's sources

define declare-module
MODULE_NAMES += $1
$1_DIR := $2
