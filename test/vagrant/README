This is configuration for the vagrant tool for fast VM
deployment/configuration.  The goal of this configuration is to make it
easy to stand up a test version of new code, so we can do system-level
regression tests without a lot of effort or error.

To use it:
 1. look at the file: manifests/init.pp
   * In the "default" node class in that file, set any variables you
     like to appropriate values for what you want to test, and include the
     correct class for what you want to test (N.B. as of now, the only
     database supported is postgresql, and the only class supported is
     "local").
 2. Start the VM:

vagrant up
    
    This should start up a vagrant VM, and run a bunch of puppet commands,
    ideally successfully.  Once it's done, if everything has gone well,
    you should be able to browse to URLs under:
      http://localhost:8088/
    and see pieces of the site
