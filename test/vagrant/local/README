To test this with a collector vagrant vm, go to:
/usr/local/ops-monitoring/local/unit-tests

python local_restart_node_interface_stats.py -b https://192.168.1.10:8043
where 192.168.1.10 is the ipaddress of the host machine (see ifconfig)

note that 127.0.0.1:8043 does not work

This enables the collector to webcrawl the localstore with the right addresses
in the local datastore's database.
