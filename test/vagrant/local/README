Any files in this directory appear in a shared folder on the VM in the
/vagrant directory.

1. To test the local datastore:

a. Make sure you have a collector tools certificate.  Look for the phrase
"tool certificate" in ops-monitoring/collector/README for instructions
on how to get one.  Below, we will use "/path/to/collector/cert" to denote
the path to your certificate file; replace this string with the actual path.

b. Build the software if not already done.
   $ cd ../../..; make; cd -

c. Bring up the VM.
   $ vagrant up

d. Provision the VM.  This makes sure the latest build is installed on
   the VM, sets up database passwords, etc.
   $ vagrant provision

e. See if you can log in to the VM.
   $ vagrant ssh
     control-D to logout

f. Try fetching some monitoring info from the web server running on the VM.
  $ curl -k --cert /path/to/collector/cert https://192.168.33.10/info/aggregate/gpo-ig
  $ curl -k --cert /path/to/collector/cert https://192.168.33.10/info/node/instageni.gpolab.bbn.com_node_pc1

g. Try fetching some monitoring info using multi_rest_call.py:
  $ cd ../../../collector/unit-tests
  $ python ./multi_rest_call.py -u https://192.168.33.10/info/aggregate/gpo-ig -c /path/to/collector/cert -v /path/to/validictory

XXX the following needs work

2. To test the local datastore with a collector on a different host:

 To test this with a collector vagrant vm, go to:
 /usr/local/ops-monitoring/local/unit-tests

 python local_restart_node_interface_stats.py -b https://192.168.1.10
 where 192.168.1.10 is the ipaddress of the host machine (see ifconfig)
