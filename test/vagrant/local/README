1. To test the local datastore as a unit test:

 As configured, Vagrant and Puppet will initialize the datastore 
 To test if valid output of the local datastore, make sure your tools
 certificate is in this directory.  If you concatenate the private key
 used to make the certificate, you will not need to copy that file
 separately. Any files in this directory are in a shared folder on
 the VM in the /vagrant directory.

 vagrant up 
 vagrant provision
 vagrant ssh

 curl -k --cert /path/to/tools-collector-cert-with-priv-key.pem https://192.168.33.10/info/aggregate/gpo-ig

 curl -k --cert /path/to/tools-collector-cert-with-priv-key.pem https://192.168.33.10/info/node/instageni.gpolab.bbn.com_node_pc1

 If you do not have your private key concatenated with your
 certificate, you'll need to specify a key with the --key </key/path>
 argument.

 For testing all the API calls, go to the
 /usr/local/ops-monitoring/collector/unit-tests directory the script:

 python ./single_rest_call.py -u https://192.168.33.10/info/aggregate/gpo-ig -c /path/to/tools-collector-cert-with-priv-key.pem -v /path/to/validictory

 python ./multi_rest_call.py -u https://192.168.33.10/info/aggregate/gpo-ig -c /path/to/tools-collector-cert-with-priv-key.pem -v /path/to/validictory

XXX the following needs work

2. To test the local datastore with a collector on a different host:

 To test this with a collector vagrant vm, go to:
 /usr/local/ops-monitoring/local/unit-tests

 python local_restart_node_interface_stats.py -b https://192.168.1.10
 where 192.168.1.10 is the ipaddress of the host machine (see ifconfig)
